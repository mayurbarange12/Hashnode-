## What is Docker?üê≥

üê≥Docker is a platform that allows developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers.üöÄContainers are lightweight, standalone, and executable packages that contain everything needed to run the software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Docker provides a way toüì¶üíª package and distribute applications along with their dependencies in a consistent and portable manner, regardless of the environment they are run inüåê‚ú®.

## Basics of Docker

* Docker was first released in March 2013, It was developed by Solomon Hykes and Sebastien Paul.
    
* Docker is an open-source centralized platform designed to create deploy and run applications.
    
* Docker uses the container on the host OS to run applications. It allows applications to use the same Linux Kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual OS.
    
* We can install Docker on any OS but the Docker engine runs natively on Linux distribution.
    
* Docker is written in the "GO" language.
    
* Docker is a tool that performs OS-level virtualization, also known as containerization.
    
* Before Docker, many users faced the problem that a particular code running in the developer's system but not in the user's system.
    

## Advantages of Docker

* No pre-allocation of RAM.
    
* CI Efficiency -&gt; Docker enables you to build a container image and use it. That same image is across every step of the deployment process.
    
* Less Cost.
    
* It is light in weight.
    
* I can run on physical hardware, Virtual Hardware, on Cloud.
    
* You can re-use the image.
    
* It took very less time to create the container.
    

## Disadvantages of Docker

* Docker is not a good solution for application that requires a rich GUI.
    
* Difficult to manage a large number of containers.
    
* Docker does not provide cross-platform compatibility means if an application is designed to run in a docker container on Windows, then it can't run on Linux or vice-versa.
    
* Docker is suitable when the development OS and testing OS are the same, if the OS is different, we should use a Virtual Machine.
    
* No solution for Data Recovery and Backup.

### **Virtualization**

Virtualization in Docker involves running multiple isolated containers on a single host operating system, allowing applications to be abstracted from the underlying infrastructure, ensuring efficient resource utilization and providing consistency across different environments.

### **Hypervisor**

A hypervisor is a software that enables the creation and management of virtual machines, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.

## **Why Docker is Lightweight?**

Docker is lightweight due to its use of containerization, sharing the host OS kernel among containers, and employing a layered file system, resulting in minimal duplication and efficient resource utilization.

### **Kernel**

The kernel is the core component of an operating system that manages system resources and facilitates communication between hardware and software.

### **Docker Engine**

The Docker Engine is the core component of Docker that manages containers, handling container runtime, image management, networking, and interfacing with the Docker daemon to execute container-related commands.

The Docker engine takes two things:-

    <mark>Containerd</mark>
    
* <mark>Docker CLI</mark>

### **Dockerd**

Dockerd is the Docker daemon responsible for managing Docker containers, handling container runtime, image management, networking, and interfacing with the Docker Engine API to execute container-related commands and operations.

### **Containerd**

Containerd is an industry-standard core container runtime, providing an essential layer between the operating system and container engines, managing the container lifecycle and providing a consistent interface for various container systems like Docker and Kubernetes.

### **Docker CLI**

Docker CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that enables users to interact with Docker, issuing commands to manage containers, images, networks, volumes, and other Docker-related functionalities through a command-line interface. It serves as the primary interface for Docker operations and configurations.
